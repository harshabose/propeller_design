# propulsion_system_analysis

A simple yet powerful tool to analyse and optimise propulsion system aerodynamics and conceptual layout.
With the rise of UAVs and eVTOL aircraft, a simple algorithm to test the performance of a given propulsion system
layout in the conceptual state is crucial for the development cycle of the aircraft. Thus, I developed this tool

The tools uses a non-linear vortex wake BEMT model with correction factor to simulate the aerodynamics of the blades of the propellers.
From the solved aerodynamics matrices, the performance of the propulsion system are calculated allowing for rapid yet accurate modelling
of propulsion systems in the early stage of developement cycle.

## How to use?
The whole package is in the form of docker file. Which when run, creates a virtual environment on your setup and installs all dependencies.
To run the tool,

``` bash
  git clone 
```j
